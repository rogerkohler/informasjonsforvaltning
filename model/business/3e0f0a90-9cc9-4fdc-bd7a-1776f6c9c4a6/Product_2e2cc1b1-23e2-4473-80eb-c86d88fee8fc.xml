For example: use-case specification, archiectual requirements, network diagrams, etc. Classiied as: Catalogs, matrices or diagrams (pictures of things)&#xA;&#x9;- catalogs - lists of things (being building blocks)&#xA;&#x9;- matrix - two dimensional matrixes. e.g  that maps two building blocks&#xA;&#x9;- diagram - visuelt.&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;It is about&#xA;* Definition of Architecture Artifacts&#xA;* Definition of Architecture Deliverables&#xA;* Definition of Building Blocks&#xA;* Content Metamodel (core+full)&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;Content Metamodel defines all the types of entities, building blocks&#xA;* Defines how they can be described and related to on another&#xA;* Promotes better integration between different architectures&#xA;&#xA;Example:&#xA;* Actor - a person, organization, or system that is outside the organization&#xA;* Application Component&#xA;* Business service"/>
